# Neural Network Experiments

This repository contains various experiments and implementations related to neural networks and machine learning

## Repository Structure

### pytorch_self_reference/

Various things in pytorch/matplotlib for self-reference

### perceptron_language/

A simple experiment exploring perceptron-based language modeling visualization using matplotlib's `imshow`. While
perceptrons are not really used for language modeling tasks, this implementation is a self-educational
guide of basic neural network concepts applied to text

### linear_acorn_sat_climate/

A very simple linear model of [Acorn Surface Air Temperature Weather Stations](https://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data/acorn-sat/)

### alice_in_wonderland_language/

Experiments in trying to train an RNN on next-word prediction for Alice in Wonderland as an arbitrarily difficult text
* Dataset quality and cleaning, and effect
* Effects of various hyperparameters
